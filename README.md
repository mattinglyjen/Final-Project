Final Project Proposal: 
Machine Learning to Find Fake News

Team: Robin Evans, Jennifer Duffy, Jennifer Mattingly


The objective of our project is to use machine learning to determine whether a given article is fake or real news. We will create a web-based user interface in which a user can type in some text and the algorithm will predict whether the news is fake or real.


Data Source:

The process will be as follows:<br>

•	Use Python to import the dataset.<br>
•	Perform exploratory data analysis and visualize the dataset.<br>
•	Perform data cleaning such as removing stop words.<br>
•	Perform tokenizing for the model.<br>
•	Build and train the model.<br>
•	Assess the performance of the model.<br>
•	Deploy the app to the web.<br>


Tools/ libraries:
<br>
Python/ Pandas<br>
Python Matplotlib<br>
Scikit-Learn/other machine learning libraries<br>
SQL (pgAdmin)<br>
Amazon Web Services (AWS)<br>
Heroku (Web deployment)<br>
	


Companies, governments, and other entities can use this type of process to determine the likelihood of whether a news article that is being spread by social media or other means is fake or is true.
