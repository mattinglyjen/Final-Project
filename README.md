Final Project Proposal: 
Machine Learning to Find Fake News

Team: Robin Evans, Jennifer Duffy, Jennifer Mattingly


The objective of our project is to use machine learning to determine whether a given article is fake or real news. We will create a web-based user interface in which a user can type in some text and the algorithm will predict the percentage probability that it is fake.


Data Source:

https://www.kaggle.com/clmentbisailon/fake-and-real-news-dataset

  
The process will be as follows:<br>

•	Use Python to import the dataset.
•	Perform exploratory data analysis and visualize the dataset.
•	Perform data cleaning such as removing stop words.
•	Perform tokenizing for the model.
•	Build and train the model.
•	Assess the performance of the model.
•	Deploy the app to the web.<br>


Tools/ libraries:<br>

Python/ Pandas
Python Matplotlib
Scikit-Learn/other machine learning libraries
SQL (pgAdmin)
Amazon Web Services (AWS)
Heroku (Web deployment)
	


Companies, governments, and other entities can use this type of process to determine the likelihood of whether a news article that is being spread by social media or other means is fake or is true.
